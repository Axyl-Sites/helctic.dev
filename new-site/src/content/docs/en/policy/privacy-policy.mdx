Helctic is a community-driven project that focuses on providing a lightweight and customizable Linux distribution.

Helctic does not collect personal information about users by default. However, it's important to note that, when you use Helctic, you may install various software packages, tools, or applications that have their own privacy policies. These policies are specific to the respective software and not directly related to Helctic itself.

When installing software on Helctic, it's crucial to review the privacy policies of individual applications or services that you use or interact with. This is especially important for any third-party applications or services you install on top of the Helctic distribution.
