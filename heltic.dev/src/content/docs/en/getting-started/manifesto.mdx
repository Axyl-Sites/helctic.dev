**Helctic** is a sign of what was, what is to come, and the power of OSS when people unite around it.

Being build on Helctic, Helctic will be a symbol of stablity, trust, and security among the operating system world.

Working on Axyl will get you labled a fool, a weirdo, and an outcast, but no visionary can say they never had any ememies.

Helctic will be the OS that kills them all, verisitle, supportive, and easy to use. For any Questions be sure to visit our Commmunity pages

We look forward to working with you!
