  <Card title="Secure" icon="star">
   Helctic is a Rust Microkernel, being build from the ground up to be simplistic, minimal, sectioned, and secure.
   With no drivers in the kernel space, and only one process being able to interact with the kernel, security is a top priority.
   we also employ a strong bug hunting program so we can ensure security in Helctic
  </Card>
  <Card title="User-oriented" icon="star">
    the Kernel SDK allows native use of Windows and Mac drivers
    the rootCORP Games Anticheat will allow games to be played natively on Helctic
    All This is work to **improving user experience**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance" icon="rocket">
    **UNIX Style Init System** We are replacing Systemd with a detailed series of scripts, this will
    increase speed, reduce load times, and remove any single points of failure.
    Configured to load the **bare minimum** for its purpose. **No useless services** or **modules** consuming your resources.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexibilty" icon="puzzle">
    Being **flexible** as possible, leading to a unique user experience with the power to change **every aspect** of the kernel.
